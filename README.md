### Research
I use a low frequency acoustic monitoring technique called infrasound to characterize the eruptive dynamics of Steamboat Geyser (Yellowstone National Park). I use digital signal processing of time series data in my analyses which requires use of scientific computing. 


## Course Goals

1. Goal 1 : Practice using Python language in my research and eventually switch over to primarily using python (semester goal)
2. Goal 2 : Be more independent at troubleshooting (daily/weekly practice)
3. Goal 3 : Set deadlines and be better with SMART goal progression (weekly goal)

### SMART Goals

| Letter   | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| S | Specific    |
| M | Measureable |
| A | Achievable  |
| R | Relevant    |
| T | Time-bound  |
